Identification of mutations in genomic regions directly targeted by publicly available PCR primers in SARS-CoV-2 samples

As variations among the SARS-CoV-2 genome are changing constantly, concerns have emerged over the possibility of decreased diagnostic accuracy of RT-PCR. Therefore constant monitoring of variations in the PCR primer target regions is highly recommended, as the RT-PCR is still the gold standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose an analysis pipeline to discover genomic variations in comparison to the original Wuhan reference sequence that overlaps the target regions of the commonly used or published PCR primer sets. Our results showed that the majority of the observed variants were not at high risk that would be tolerated. Only three exceptions should be highlighted: one multiple 'ACC' mutation, one deletion, and one SNP in a primer near the 3â€² end. Our approach is unique in both the sense that we only included good-quality samples and high-confidence variants determined from raw sequencing data in our analysis instead of investigating consensus sequences, and in its comprehensive way of differentiating between harmless and possibly damaging mutations.
